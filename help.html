<a name="quicksearch"><h4>How does the Quick Search box work?</h4></a>

The Quick Search box is a tool that allows you to quickly choose a search option and location so that you can immediately begin searching. With it, you may quickly perform almost any type of search in any part of the Bridges Catalog. Press the arrow at the end of the "Select a Library" box to change library locations and the arrow next to the "Search by" box to change the type of search. If you are not familiar with the Catalog, we suggest you look below the Quick Search box and choose the link for an individual type of search (e.g. author, title, etc.).  Once you've selected a type of search, you will find search tips and examples to help you with your research. 

<a name="search2"><h4>How do I know which type of search to use?</h4></a>    

<dl>
<dd>To help you decide which search option to use, the different types of searches available, descriptions of what they search, examples of searches, and search tips for each are listed below.<p>

		<ul>
		<li>tale of two cities
		<li>tale of tw
		<li>journal of american history
		<li>journal of american hist
		</ul>
	<dd>If the title is not found, try removing the initial article and rerun the query.
	<dd>Type a "pipe" character ("|") at the end of your search phrase to limit the search to the exact title entered. For example:
		<ul>
		<li>science| (finds one word title: science)
		<li>science (finds titles beginning with science)
		</ul>
	</dl>
<p>
<dd><b>Author Search</b>

</dl>


<a name="search3"><h4>I retrieved  too many items with my search.</h4></a>
Here are some ways that you can decrease the number of items you retrieve:

<ol>
<li><b>Use the word 'AND' to do a keyword search on more than one concept.</b>  The computer will look for items that have <u>both</u> terms in the record.  'AND' allows the terms to be anywhere within the record and in any order (case does not matter).   
	<dl>
	<dd>Example: television and children 
	</dl>
<br>
<li><b>Use the 'Limit/Sort' or 'Modify Search' button to narrow to a particular publication year or years, material type, language, etc.</b> These tools allow you to restrict the results you see to match whatever criteria you input.  For example, you can have the computer rerun a search on World War II but limit the results to videotapes on the topic. 
<br><br>

<li><b>Do a Subject search instead of a keyword search</b>  
 LC Subject Searches utilize a standardized list of terms used to describe the topic of an item.  Medical and Children's Subject Searches also can be used to search for materials in those specialized areas. 
<br><br>

<li><b>When viewing a record for an item you retrieved, check the 'LC Subject' field to find more specific headings/terms.</b> Scroll down through the record of an item you retrieved until you see the LC Subject area. Here you will find suggestions for other subject terms you may use. A search for materials on the Vietnam War, for example, will yield books with the following subject headings/terms:
	<dl>
	<dd>Vietnamese Conflict, 1961-1975 -- United States
	<dd>Vietnamese Conflict, 1961-1975 -- Moral And Ethical Aspects
	</dl>
<br>
<li><b>Do a Title search instead of a keyword search.</b>  Sometimes you can find books with titles that begin with your search term, e.g. Management. If this does not work, perform a keyword search and type 't:' in front of a word to search for that word <u>anywhere</u> within the title of a work. This should also produce fewer results than a keyword search.
	<dl>
	<dd>Example: t:France 
	<dd>Results:
		<ul>
		<li>France against herself: a perceptive study of France's past, her politics, and 				her unending crises  
		<li>An introduction to seventeenth century France.
		<li>Chardin and the still-life tradition in France / Gabriel P. Weisberg with 					William S. Talbot. 
		</ul>
	</dl>
<br>
<li><b>Use the word 'NOT' to omit keywords.  </b> The computer will look for items that mention the first term but omit any items that mention the term after the 'NOT'. 
	<dl>
	<dd>Example: South America NOT Brazil 
	</dl>
<br>
<li><b>Use a proximity operator.</b> Use the word 'within' and a number to specify proximity of words to one another, in any order. 
	<dl>
	<dd>Example: employment within 3 discrimination      
	</dl>

</ol>


<a name="search4"><h4>I found too few items with my search.</h4></a>

Here are some ways that you can increase the number of items you retrieve:

<ol>
<li><b>Do a Keyword search instead of a LC Subject, Medical Subject or Children's Subject search.</b>
  A keyword search covers more fields, such as title, notes, etc.
<br><br>
<li><b>Use the word 'OR' to search on variations of a concept.</b>  
To give the computer more choices, use 'OR' to link two words with the same meaning, either of which would satisfy your needs.
	<dl>
	<dd>Example:	 

		<dl>
		<dd>deaf or hearing impaired
		<dd>Greek or Latin
		</dl>
	</dl>
<br>
<li><b>Use an asterisk* to truncate endings of words.</b>  Have the computer search for variations of a root word by adding an asterisk to the end of the word.  For example, type train* to search for training, trainers, train, trains, etc.
<br><br>
</ol>
<a name="search5"><h4>I didn't get anything!</h4></a>

Here are some suggestions if your search gets zero results:
<ol>
<li><b>Check your spelling.</b> The "Did you mean..." feature may offer alternative spellings.  If any are appropriate, select them and conduct the search again.  You can also use an asterisk * at the end of a word if you know the root of a word.
	<dl>
	<dd>Example: Dostoevsk* (will find Dostoevsky or Dostoevskii)
	</dl>
<br>

If you want the computer to fill in more than 5 letters, use two asterisks:
	<dl>
	<dd>Example: totalit**   (for a search on totalitarianism)
	</dl>
<br>
<li><b>If you are not using a keyword search, try it.</b>   This is the broadest type of search you can do.
<br><br>

<li><b>Make sure you are doing the correct type of search.</b>  Trying to search for an author in the journal name field will not yield you the results you probably wanted.  Check that you have selected the correct type of search.
<br><br>

<li><b>Do a simple search on fewer keywords.</b>  Try simplifying your search by limiting the number of words you are stringing together with the word 'and'.  For example, instead of 'personnel and training and computer-assisted instruction and evaluation', try one of the following searches:
	<dl>
	<dd>'computer-assisted instruction and evaluation'
	<dd>'training and computer-assisted instruction'
	</dl>
<br>
<li><b>Try to search in the entire MOBIUS catalog to see if another library has the material(s) you want.</b> It's possible that your library does not own the materials you need.  In this case, you can search what is called the MOBIUS catalog to see if one of almost 60 libraries in Missouri owns the material.  If you can find it in the MOBIUS catalog, the material can then be shipped to your library for you to use.  For information on MOBIUS, follow this <a href="http://mobius.umsystem.edu/screens/about_mobius.html">link</a>.  Select the 'Search MOBIUS' button to enter the MOBIUS catalog. 

</ol>
<a name="search6"><h4>I want to limit my search but am confused by the "Material Type" options.</h4></a>

Most of the material types, or formats of the item, are familiar ones like books, journals, maps, etc.  Some of the less familiar ones include:
<dl>
<dd><b>Thesis or Manuscript:</b> Thesis includes master's theses and doctoral dissertations.  Manuscripts may include authored works, correspondence and other documents related to an individual or group.  Manuscripts are often kept in separate collections.<p>

<dd><b>Electronic Resource:</b> A resource such as a CD-ROM, online database, etc.  As a rule, regular music CDs are grouped under Audio, Music rather than Electronic Resource.  Electronic books are grouped under the E-Book material type.<p>

<dd><b>Video:</b> Includes formats such as VHS, laserdisc, DVD, etc.<p>

<dd><b>Archival Material:</b> Collections of documents, photographs, media, etc. that are the official records of an organization or institution.  Archival materials are usually kept in separate collections.
</dl>


<a name="view"><h3>Viewing Your Results/Locating Materials</h3></a>

<a name="view1"><h4>How do I know which library owns the book I need?</h4></a>

In the Bridges Catalog, when you do a search and view the record for an item, you will see a box marked "Location".  Here you will find an abbreviation for each library that owns the item in question.  Here is a key to some of the more common abbreviations you might find:
<pre>
	COV		Covenant Theological Seminary
	FONT		Fontbonne University
	HS		Harris-Stowe State University
	K-GS		Kenrick-Glennon Theological Seminary
	LU		Lindenwood University
	MBU		Missouri Baptist University 
</pre>

If you are searching the comprehensive MOBIUS catalog, you will see two columns.  The first column labeled 'Library' is the cluster that the library listed in the 'Shelving Location' column belongs to.  If you are unaware of the abbreviation for each library, you can click on the abbreviation and a description will appear or refer to the list of MOBIUS libraries available 
<a href="http://mobius.umsystem.edu/screens/libinfo.html">online</a>.

<a name="view2"><h4>The book I want says the status is "Library Use Only".  Does that mean I can't borrow it?</h4></a>

 
"Library Use Only" materials are often reference books, rare books, archival documents, or other special materials that the owning library does not wish to lend.  However, many of these items can be used by visiting the library that owns them.  For rare books or archival materials, it's a good idea to call ahead to see if special arrangements need to be made.  Often rare books and similar materials are kept in special collections which may have more restricted hours and access policies than the general library.

<a name="view3"><h4>My instructor wants us to use recently published materials.  How can I tell from my results list when each item was published without having to look at each one individually?</h4></a>
Once you have done a search,  press the "Limit/Sort" button (if available) on the button bar across the top of the screen.  On the page that appears, click in the "Sort results by year" box and press the "Limit/sort items" button below.  Your search results will be redisplayed in publication date order.  The date will be visible to the right of each item listed.


<a name="mark"><h3>Marking Records/Making Lists</h3></a>

<a name="mark1"><h4>How can I print/download/email a list of items from the catalog?</h4></a>
<ol>
<li>Do a search and have the search results on your screen.
<li>Place a check mark in the box beside each item you want.
<li>Press the 'Save Marked Records' button at the top or bottom of the page.
<li>Continue to mark and save records on subsequent pages.
<li>When ready to retrieve your list, press the 'View Saved' button on the button bar.
<li>The screen that appears will provide options for emailing or saving the list.  You may also display it on your screen and print it out.
</ol>

<a name="mark2"><h4>I marked some records but I don't see the option to print or email my list.</h4></a>

 
When you mark records, you must press the "Save Marked Records" button at the bottom of each page.  If you leave a page without pressing this button, your marks will disappear.  Once you have saved your marked records, you will see a button at the top of the page which allows you to view your list.

	<dl>
	<dd>You can renew any materials you have checked out by entering your library account.  To do this, choose the option at the bottom of the main search screen labeled 'View Your Library Account'.
